	<h3 class="mt-5"><em>&lt;template/&gt;</em> Request Demo</h3>

	<p class="lead">A series of example apps that demonstrate the use of a template protocol to support modern web UX.</p>

	<h5 class="mt-5">What is a template request?</h5>

	<p>
		A convention that web links, forms and components can use, with XHR, to send a normal request and receive
		an update for the current page instead of a new HTML document.
	</p>

	<h5 class="mt-4">Motivation</h5>

	<p>
		The goal is to allow a standard HTML web server to support basic interactivity
		by extending the protocol that is already in use. This will
		hopefully reduce the need for web apps to expand custom APIs to support
		minor dynamic controls.
	</p>

	<h5>The protocol</h5>

	<p>
		Using an <code>Accept</code><sup>[1]</sup> header, the client indicates to the web server that a template is
		expected as a response. If implemented, a HTML template fragment will be sent in the response body.
		That template will be applied to the requesting document using a find and replace strategy.
	</p>

	<pre class="alert alert-primary px-3 rounded"><code>&gt; GET /content_a HTTP/1.1
  Accept: application/x.treetop-html-template+xml

&lt; HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Content-Type: application/x.treetop-html-template+xml
  X-Page-URL: /content_a
  Vary: Accept

  &lt;template&gt;
    &lt;div id="content"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id="nav"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/template&gt;</code>
	</pre>

	<p>That might seems too simple to be useful so the example apps were created to demonstrate
	how common controls can be implemented using the protocol.</p>

	<h5 class="mt-4">Third-party libraries</h5>

	<p>
		As you might have already guessed, this page and all demo apps use the <a href="">Bootstrap Component Library</a>.
		Styling and markup is intended to be as familiar and conventional as possible<sup>[2]</sup>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The protocol described here was developed along with the <a href="">Treetop library</a>, a Go package for building HTML
		web pages from nested templates. That library is used to implement the server-side handlers for the demo apps.
